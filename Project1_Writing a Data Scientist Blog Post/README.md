## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We used Airbnb data to research how much it costs to stay in Seattle.:

1. What are the prices listings?
2. When is the cheapest time of year?
3. Which accommodation conditions are relevant to the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

One notebook has been provided to introduce the work associated with the above questions; Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for the individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sho_nakamura/how-much-does-it-cost-to-stay-in-seattle-e10a13cc7601)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
